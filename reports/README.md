# Project Plan 
Final Project for IS 477 by team jojo â€” "jo"celyn and jian "jo."

## Overview 
We will be aiming to answer our research question to the best of our ability according to our datasets using tools that we have been taught in class. 

## Research Question 
What are the most effective factors contributing to the students' performance in higher education (college) and secondary education (high school)? Is there a significant difference between the two groups or not? 

## Team 
we're planning to work on the project in person together, meaning that the workload will be fairly distributed among the two of us. 

- Jian Jo: focus on data analysis more
- Jocelyn Yang: focus on writing down the findings on the report paper more
  
## Datasets 
This project requires two datasets from APIs: one for the higher education and the other for the secondary education. 
- higher education: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance 
- secondary education: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success
